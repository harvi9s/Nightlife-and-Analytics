Technologies:
We used the Google API in order to create our map and charts, HTML to organize our data, CSS to style our webpage, and JavaScript to allow user interactivity.  
For our back end we used PHP and MySQL.
We created our tables via SQL and organize our data and formatted it properly in Microsoft Excel creating .csv files.  The .csv filed made it simple to import our data into our SQL tables.
We used PHP to connect to our database and submit our queries in order to pull the needed information and display it to the user.
